        My name is Arunash Kanna. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Criminology and Police Science. I completed my higher secondary education through the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), which is a central government-recognized open school system.

        Before joining NIOS, I studied from Grade 8 to Grade 11 at a school under the Auroville Foundation, named NESS (New Era Secondary School). Due to personal reasons, I discontinued my studies there and chose the open school path to complete my higher secondary education.
